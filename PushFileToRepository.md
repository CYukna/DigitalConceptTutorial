## Using the Command Line

Below I will be discussing how to push/commit a local project on your MacOS computer into your new GitHub repository. 

#### Step 1
First we must clone the repository URL to our local system (Terminal). This can be down by clicking the green "Clone or download" drop down menu and clicking on the notebook icon as shown:

#### Step 2
Next we need to clone the GitHub repository you have created to our local computer. Here we will be using the git command "git clone". This command creates a new directory and has remote-tracking ability in the cloned repository. For the sake of this tutorial, I have cloned my "Hello-World" repo to my desktop as shown below:

"cd" is a terminal command that allows me to open up my desktop file on my Mac to allow for the repo to be cloned to.
