## Using the Command Line

Below I will be discussing how to clone a repository on your MacOS computer, edit it, and push the file back into your new GitHub repository. 

#### Step 1
First we must clone the repository URL to our local system (Terminal). This can be down by clicking the green "Clone or download" drop down menu and clicking on the notebook icon as shown:

#### Step 2
Next, we need to clone the GitHub repository you have created to our local computer. Here we will be using the git command "git clone". This command creates a new directory and has remote-tracking ability in the cloned repository. For the sake of this tutorial, I have cloned my "Hello-World" repo to my desktop as shown below:

"cd" is a terminal command that allows me to open up my desktop file on my Mac to allow for the repo to be cloned to.

Hello-World folder shows up in my desktop and is available to be edited. 

#### Step 3
To be edited, I converted the Hello-World file into a text editor. I added a little note to show a before and after in the "Hello-World" repository I created.

#### Step 4 
Below I will perform the git command "git status". I have edited the README.md file at this point. Terminal knows that the file has been modified but not yet added back to the README.md file stored on Desktop. (Hence the red text)
