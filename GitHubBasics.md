You may be asking what version control means. Version control is the system Git utilizes to record changes to files or a set of files overtime. When developers are creating a video game or application, for example, there are constant changes being made to the code for higher quality versions up until the final product. Version control allows a user to revert back to a previous state if issues arise. This functionality is available through Terminal on MacOS.
