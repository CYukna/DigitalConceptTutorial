## Creating a Repository

A repository is essentially a folder or storage space where your GitHub projects will be located. Your text files, code files, image files, etc. will be stored in your designated repository you create. You can manage your projects work within the repository as well as each file's history. You can use repositories individually, but you can also use repositories to share your projects with other GitHub users. As you continue along in the world of technology you may here professors or fellow students refer to repositories as an abbreviation: "repo".

Below I will walk through how to create a repository:

#### Step 1:
There will be a "+" drag down menu in the top right corner of your GitHub accounts home screen. Click on the drop down menu and select "New repository"

#### Step 2:
Create a short title for your repository. It is recommended that your repository does not contain spaces due to the fact that it may cause issues during pushing/commiting of files in Terminal (I'll get to that on the next page). An example of a proper repo title would be "HelloWorld" or "Hello-World" and is also shown below. 
A short description is optional but may be helpful for professors or other students to locate and understand your repo.
