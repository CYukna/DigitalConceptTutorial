## Creating a Repository

A repository is essentially a folder or storage space where your GitHub projects will be located. Your text files, code files, image files, etc. will be stored in your designated repository you create. You can manage your projects work within the repository as well as each file's history. You can use repositories individually, but you can also use repositories to share your projects with other GitHub users. As you continue along in the world of technology you may here professors or fellow students refer to repositories as an abbreviation: "repo".

Below I will walk through how to create a repository:

#### Step 1:
There will be a "+" drag down menu in the top right corner of your GitHub accounts home screen. Click on the drop down menu and select "New repository"

#### Step 2:
Create a short title for your repository. It is recommended that your repository does not contain spaces due to the fact that it may cause issues during pushing/commiting of files in Terminal (I'll get to that on the next page). An example of a proper repo title would be "HelloWorld" or "Hello-World" and is also shown below. 

A short description is optional but may be helpful for professors or other students to locate and understand your repo.

#### Step 3:
Here you can either chose to make your repository public or private. A public repository is visible to the GitHub community while a private repository is only available to you individually and those users you share it with.

#### Step 4:
More often than not you are going to want to "initialize the repository with "README.md". Good documentation is key to a successful start to your project. README files are the first file shown in your repository and consists of the title of your repo at the top followed by the description you input. 

README files are easy to modify and is a quick way to add a description or basic information about your project.

Congrats! You have created a repository. Continue to learn how to input files through Terminal into your new repository.
