## Creating a Repository

A repository is essentially a folder or storage space where your GitHub projects will be located. Your text files, code files, image files, etc. will be stored in your designated repository you create. You can manage your projects work within the repository as well as each file's history. You can use repositories individually, but you can also use repositories to share your projects with other GitHub users. 

Below I will walk through how to create a repository:

##### Step 1:
There will be a "+" in the top right corner of your accounts main screen. Click the pull down menu and select "Create repository"
